WHY: Week 1 Founders & Coders project.  
WHAT: A one-page website to present our team of developers to prospective clients.  

We had the following user stories:

We want you to work together over the next few days to build a small site from scratch that provides a short portfolio for you and your team.

To describe what features should be implemented, these are the user stories that should be satisfied;

I want to visit your site and immediately see a headline about your team
So that I get a concise description of what you have to offer me.

I would like to visit your site and get a similar experience to viewing your site on a modern browser with JavaScript enabled
so that I don't feel like I'm completely in the stone age.

HOW:

1. We spent the first few hours of our project time brainstorming. We did this by discussing general
   ideas and using the whiteboard to sketch out a design. We also created a shared document with ideas for content and design in general. We divided our website into four sections we could work on.

2. Split into pairs to work on the first two sections of the website. we gave ourselves a time limit of one and a half hours after which we came back together as a group and compared code. During this point in time we found issues with the other pairs code and raised these on github. We then went back to our original pairs and worked to resolve the issues raised.

3. At this point in time we had a better understanding of what we could achieve in the time given, and as such we devised a schedule of how we would complete the work. we then repeated step 2.

4. For the final few hours we worked to resolve issues with our code as well as working to ensure it is more accessible.
