WHY: Week 1 Founders & Coders project.  
WHAT: A one-page website to present our team of developers to prospective clients.  
HOW:
1. Brainstormed ideas of design and layout, drawing on a whiteboard. Mobile-first design.
2. Created a shared document with ideas for content and design and agreed on basic design principles.
3. Split into 2 pairs to work on different sections.
4. After working for an hour or 2 in pairs, we pushed to github and merged everything.
5. We then looked at each others work, making notes and adding issues to github. At this stage we had a better idea of what kind of timeline we wanted to stick to.
6. We then worked on the issues trying to resolve them. If there were any issues to resolve we came back to the whole group.
7. After the issues were resolved, we switched pairs and began working on the second half of our website.
8. We came back together as a group after an hour or two of work and merged in github.
9. Once again we raised issues and discussed a timeline for finishing.
10. For the final few hours we worked over code we had written, ensuring the site was accessible as possible.
